# Intelliveer Event Management

## Overview

Intelliveer Event Management is a web application designed to help users manage and organize events efficiently. The application allows users to add, view, edit, and delete events. Events are stored in **local storage**, meaning data persists even after page refresh, but users need to manually add events to see data.

## Features

- Add new events with title, date, and location
- View events in a tabular list
- Edit or delete existing events
- Search events by title or location
- Filter events by date
- View events in a calendar format
- Data is stored in **local storage** for persistence
- Responsive and easy-to-navigate UI

## Technologies Used

- **Angular** for frontend framework
- **Angular Material** for UI components
- **Local Storage** for data persistence
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment

## Usage Notes

- Since data is stored in **local storage**, users need to **add events manually** for data to appear.
- To clear saved events, clear the browser's local storage.

### ðŸ“Œ Important: If you don't see any data, **please add events manually** as it uses local storage.
